Description: Statistical design for RNA-seq experiments using Illumina platform, more specifically, 8-lane flow cell.
    RNA-seq experiments aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes are multi-stage experiments and many nuisance 
    technical factors may confound the effect of biological group if the experiment is not designed foloowing experimental 
    design principles. The DEdesign package will perform statistical design for RNA-seq experiments and plot the design
    in the format of 8-lane flow cell.
