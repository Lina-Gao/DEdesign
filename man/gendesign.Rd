\title{Statistical design for RNA-seq experiments aimed at identifying differentially expressed genes}
\usage{
gendesign(treatments, replicates, nperlane = NULL, seed = 1,
  searches = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{treatments}{a character vector for treatment groups. If the experiment consists of two or more factors, provide a character vector representing all possible combinations of levels across these factors.}

\item{replicates}{an integer vector for number of replicates for each element of \code{treatments}. Length of \code{replicates} has to match length of \code{treatments}.}

\item{nperlane}{An integer for number of samples per lane for sequencing. When \code{nperlane} is not provided, a number between 4-6 will be selected based on number of treatments to generate efficient design}

\item{seed}{an integer initializing the random number generator. The default is \code{seed=1}. Designs can be rebuilt repeatedly using different seed to check that a near-optimum design has been found.}

\item{searches}{the maximum number of local optima searched at each stage of a treatment and block design optimization. The default depends on the design size. For optimum results, try large number of searches.}
}
\value{
\code{input} A list showing input parameters to the function

\code{Design} A list with two elements: \code{design} and \code{BlocksEfficiency}. \code{design} is a data frame giving lane and adaptor assignment for treatment groups. \code{BlocksEfficiency} is a data frame giving block efficiencies (D-Efficiencies) for lane and adaptor.

\code{suggestedDesign} When possible, \code{suggestedDesign} uses different number of samples per lane from the input to give more efficient block design; otherwise it is the same as \code{Design}.  \code{suggestedDesign} is a list with two elements: \code{design} and \code{BlocksEfficiency}. \code{design} is a data frame giving lane and adaptor assignment for treatment groups. \code{BlocksEfficiency} is a data frame giving block efficiencies (D-Efficiencies) for lane and adaptor.
